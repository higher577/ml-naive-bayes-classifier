This is a basic machine learning Naive Bayes text classifier built from scratch (in Python using Jupyter notebook) using Pandas and NumPy with additional experiments using scikit-learn. The model is trained on a dataset of student project descriptions to classify each description into one of four fields: Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Privacy & Security, Game Development, or Web Development.

 - Implemented Naive Bayes from scratch (probability estimation + Laplace smoothing)
 - Compared results against scikit-learnâ€™s MultinomialNB implementation
 - Data preprocessing: tokenization, vocabulary construction, and feature extraction
 - Posterior probability calculation for predictions
 - Evaluation using accuracy and Kaggle submission (performance score: [0.90, 0.94))

All code is runnable within a single Jupyter notebook. Load the training and test CSVs (provided) and run the notebook to reproduce results and analyses.
